"""
	This Python script is written by Zhiyang Ong to sort a set of
		(key,frequency) pairs, using their keys.
	
	
	Synopsis:
	Process input arguments for a script to clean BibTeX databases.


	Notes/Assumptions:
	Do not consider the 'Annote' field as a 'standard' BibTeX field.

	Assume that each 'standard' BibTeX field is a single line field.

	If the BibTeX field 'Annote' has multiple lines, only its last
		line will end with '}}' and that 'Annote' is the last field
		of the BibTeX entry.

	Revision History:
	April 14, 2017			Version 0.2, initial build.
