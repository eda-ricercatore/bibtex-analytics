"""
	This is written by Zhiyang Ong to convert a list of names for the "Author" or "Editor" fields in BibTeX into the proper letter case.

	A number of Web pages, digital libraries, and publications tend to list the titles of publications in upper case (or capitals). Hence, we need to fix the letter case for these titles before entering them into a reference management software, such as BibTeX databases.

	
	#### TO BE FIXED
	
	+ Bug #1
		- When titles have hyphens in them, the second hyphenated term
			starts with a lower seletterca insted of an upper ase letter.
		- E.g., The Politics Of The Non-partisan League




















	References:

	Citations/references that use the LaTeX/BibTeX notation are taken from my BibTeX database
		(set of BibTeX entries).

	If these citations are not found in this list of references, information about them can be found in my BibTeX database.
