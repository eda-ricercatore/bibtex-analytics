\chapter{Future Work}
\label{chp:FutureWork}

Future work of the {\sc Bib}\TeX\ {\it Analytics} project is described as follows: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Clustering of keywords/keyphrases: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf Problem statements}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item For an author, find clusters of keyphrases, publishers, journal titles, conferences, \dots
		\item For each keyphrase, determine the cluster of publishers, years, journal titles, conferences, \dots
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Build dictionary of {\it (keyphrase, frequency)} two-tuples (or pairs).
	\item Sort the dictionary based on the frequency in these two-tuples.
	\item Alternate solution: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Build a set of {\it (keyphrase, [list of years])}
		\item {\it [list of years]} is a list of years of publications; or it is a set of years for publications that include the keyphrase {\it keyphrase}.
		\item Sort the set based on length of the list of years, {\it [list of years]}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item 
\item 
\item 
\item 
\item 
\item 
\item Find emerging research trends to consider pivoting towards, or to get involved in side projects \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item E.g., benchmark adiabatic quantum computers with topological computers and universal quantum computers \cite{Tandon2017}.
	\end{enumerate}
